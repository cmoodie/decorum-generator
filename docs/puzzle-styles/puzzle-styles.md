## The forced conditional A
### Player 1
1. Per Room, if X then Y, where Y is *quite strict*
2. One half of restriction to force X in a room
3. Restriction that increases A
4. Restriction that restricts B's location (can be weak forcing)
### Player 2
1. A \< B or A = B throughout House
2. Other half of restriction to force X in a room (can be weak forcing)
3. Restriction that clashes with Y
4. Another interesting condition

## The forced conditional B
### Player 1
1. Per Room, if X then Y, where Y is *quite strict*
2. One half of restriction to force X in a room
3. Restriction that decreases B (can be weak forcing)
4. Restriction requires A in a location
### Player 2
1. A \< B or A = B throughout House
2. Other half of restriction to force X in a room (can be weak forcing)
3. Restriction that clashes with Y
4. Restriction that requires objects

## The double forced conditional
### Player 1
1. Per Room, if X1 then Y1, where Y1 is *quite strict*
2. One half of restriction to force X1 in a room
3. Restriction that, due to Y1, requires X2
4. Restriction that clashes with Y2 (can be weak forcing)
### Player 2
1. Per Room, if X2 then Y2, where Y2 is *quite strict*
2. Other half of restriction to force X1 in a room (can be weak forcing)
3. Restriction that clashes with Y1
4. Restriction that requires objects throughout House not present in either condintioned room

## The fake conditional
### Player 1
1. Per Room, if X then Y, where Y is *quite strict*
2. One half of restriction that ensures Y is impossible
3. Restriction that increases A
4. Restriction that restricts B's location (can be weak forcing)
### Player 2
1. A \< B or A = B throughout House
2. Other half of restriction that ensures Y is impossible (can be weak forcing)
3. One half of restriction that clashes with not X
4. Other half of restriction that clashes with not X

## The no conditional
### Player 1
1. A1 \< B1 or A1 = B1 throughout House
2. One half of restriction that maps A1 to B2
3. Restriction that increases A2
4. Another interesting condition (can be weak forcing)
### Player 2
1. A2 \< B2 or A2 = B2 throughout House
2. Other half of restriction that maps A1 to B2
3. Restriction that restricts B1's location
4. Another interesting condition (can be weak forcing)
